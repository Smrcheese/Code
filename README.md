### About <a name = "about"></a>

The piscine is a 4-week intensive program that serves as a selection process for the 42 program all around the globe. My name is Samir Mercado, and I usually go by the username **@smrcheese** on socials or **sezequie** on 42 intra.

[42](https://www.42network.org) is a renowned coding school known for its unique pedagogy, which emphasizes project-based learning and peer-to-peer evaluation. The piscine is your very first challenge at 42, designed to test your ability to learn new concepts and work with others.

Feel free to explore this repository to access the code and documentation for the piscine. If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out. Good luck with your 42 Piscine! ðŸš€

### Disclaimer <a name = "disclaimer"></a>

**Please** do not shamelessly copy any code from this repository or others if you are a current piscine cadet. Doing it will only harm yourself because the examns are very hard. tis is supposed to serve as a reference how good code should look like. If you copy code from here you will not learn anything and you will not be able to pass the examns that btw are kinda of hardcore for newbies at code.
that said, dear pisciners, good luck and have fun~!

### Tips for the piscine <a name = "tips"></a>

- **Read the subject**. I know it sounds obvious but you would be surprised how many people don't really understand the subject and just start coding. The subject is your best friend even though it might not seem like it. It will tell you EXACTLY what you need to do and whats allowed, if its something is not explicitly said in the subject, then you can't do it. If you have any doubts about the subject, ask your peers.

- **TEST YOUR DAMN CODE!**. Again, obvius right? but really tho, this a million times your code and use the examples in the subject to test your code. If you are not getting the expected output, then you are doing something wrong. If you are not sure how to test your code, ask your peers to try to break your code, they will be more than happy to do so.
trust me, this will save you a lot of time and headaches.

- **Ask for help**. This is a big one, if you are stuck on a project, ask for help. There is no shame in asking for help, you are there to learn and so are your peers, take advantage of those big brain peers all piscines have and ask them for help!.

- **Take breaks**. This is a marathon, not a sprint. You will be spending a lot of time in front of your computer, so take breaks, go for a walk, eat something, take a nap, do something else, just don't spend all your time in front of your computer, you will burn out and that will make you less productive.
