# Code

Welcome to my Escole 42 code repository tat i've made during the #14 lisbon 42 piscine! (from aug 28 to sep 24 2023) Here, you'll find the projects and assignments I've been working on during my time at Escole 42. Before you dive in, I want to share a crucial piece of advice:
Disclaimer

Warning: If you're thinking of using or referencing any code from this repo, it's super important that you understand each and every line of code. Seriously! If you don't, you are just signing yourself for a bad time in the future.

Why Understanding the Code Matters:

    Learning: Escole 42 is all about hands-on learning. Copy-pasting code without understanding it won't help you grow as a coder and eventually the nightmare is going to reach out to you.

    Troubleshooting: When things go haywire (as they often do in coding), you'll need to troubleshoot. Without a solid grasp of the code, you're in for a dissaster.

    the long run: yeah, you're copying code right now but what are you going to do in a interview? during a test? are you gonna fake your habilities during your whole career?
    
In short, think of this repo as a resource to learn from, get ideas, and maybe even inspire your own projects. But please, resist the urge to copy-paste without comprehension.
